It is a book recommendation system based on kNN collaborative filtering. 

Data sets have been included as zip files. That zip contains user, books, and ratings data set. So feel free to use it. 

Notebook contains the entire code, integrate it with flask or django and you are ready to deploy. 

All the steps have been explained in notebook itself, so give it a read maybe. 

Happy Coding !
